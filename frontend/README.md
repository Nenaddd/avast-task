## NOTE

Some code is added only for demonstrating purposes, and might not be suitable for a real-world application.

## Starting Development

Start the app in the `dev` environment:

```bash
yarn start
```

## Instructions
**It is tested on Microsoft Windows OS using the NodeJS version mentioned below. There is no guarantee It will start/work as expected on other OS.**
The development server can be run locally using YARN. This allows testing of the application's code locally. 

Required dependencies on the host PC are: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

## Building and Running the Local Development Servers
1. Ensure that Node.js is installed on the host PC - Supported version is 14.15.x but others might also work
2. In the terminal, enter the `./backend` folder
3. Run the following command from the terminal in order to install the necessary dependencies:
```
yarn
```
4. Wait a few seconds
5. To start the development server, run the following command:
```
yarn start (or you can also use the nodemon or a similar package for hot-reload)
```
6. Wait for the server to start
7. You should now be able to see the NodeJs server running (at localhost:8000)

8. In the terminal, enter the `./frontend` folder
9. Run the following command from the terminal in order to install the necessary dependencies:
```
yarn
```
10. Wait a few seconds
11. To start the development server, run the following command:
```
yarn start
```
12. Wait for the server to start
13. You should now be able to see the Electron app running (at localhost:1212)

14. Congrats, You've made it! :)
